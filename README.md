## Overview

The goal for this lab is to start using resampling methods to both tune and compare models. Instead of comparing one candidate model from each model type we will now explore several candidate sub-models from each model type by tuning hyperparameters. The lab focuses on hyperparameter tuning, but this technique easily extends tuning to preprocessing techniques or tuning of structural parameters. Ultimately leading to the selection of a final/winning/best model.

This lab represents the addition of the last major step using statistical/machine learning to build a predictive model. Meaning this is a lab that represents going through the entire process from start to finish.

This lab covers material up to and including [13. Grid search (section 13.3)](https://www.tmwr.org/grid-search.html) from [Tidy Modeling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/).

## Instructions

After creating your own GitHub repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the exercises provided in `L08_model_tuning.html`. A template is also provided (rename as `lastname_firstname_L08.qmd`).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which **must contain a link to your github repo**. Including the GitHub repo link provides all the support materials needed to reproduce your work, an essential feature of quality scientific work, especially data science/analysis work. See canvas for submission details.
